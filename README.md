# Netflixvideos


  This is a Tableau Project that I was wanting to show the movies and tv shows relations on Netflix.
  When you go through this you can see where a lot of movies were made in each region.
  You can also see the most popular genres that are most watched as well as which have more videos and TV shows in the genre as well.
  If you take the time and look through all of this you will see the ending dashboard as well as the interactive Tableau book when you click on the three dots.
  But thank you in advance on checking out my profile as well as commenting on what you think about this.
